## Usage

Use the following command to create a new Open Restaurant development project:

`$ composer create-project openrestaurant/openrestaurant-project:8.x-dev myrestaurant --stability dev --no-interaction`

Composer will pull in the openrestaurant profile and all required dependencies. A `web` directory will be created and the Drupal code will be placed there. You can then install it like you would any other Drupal site.
